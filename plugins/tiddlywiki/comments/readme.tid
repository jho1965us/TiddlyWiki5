title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/comments/readme

This plugin provides a simple means for adding threaded comments to tiddlers.

* Click the "add comment" button to make a new comment, and then click the "save" button to save it
* You can comment on a tiddler itself, or add a comment to an existing comment
* The sidebar tab ''Comments'' lists a timeline of all comments
* Comments are attributed to the username stored in the system tiddler [[$:/status/UserName]]
* By default, comments are available on all non-system tiddlers. The ''config'' tab lets you customise which tiddlers can accept comments by specifying a filter extension
* The buttons for adding and editing comments are only available if the system tiddler [[$:/status/IsReadOnly]] is not set to `yes`
