!! Major Improvements

!!! Node.js HTTP Server

The HTTP WebServer functionality has been significantly improved:

* Adds ability to make a wiki that is read-only for anonymous users, but allows editing for users who log in
* Adds support for serving static file attachments over HTTP
* Adds support for multiple user credentials for basic authentication via a CSV file containing usernames/passwords
* Hides UI features like the new tiddler button and the edit button when the user only has read-only access to the wiki
* Adds support for serving over HTTPS as well as HTTP
* Adds support for authentication via a trusted header, making it easier to integrate with corporate single sign on (and Windows authentication)
* Adds support for more fine grained authorisation (ie granting/denying individual users read/write permission to resources)
* Better debugging information
* Experimental support for a new, plain HTML single tiddler per page view
* Adds a simple level of [[CSRF protection|WebServer Parameter: csrf-disable]]
* Deprecating the existing “-—server” command in favour of a new “—-listen” command using the new NamedCommandParameters support for named parameters that can be specified in any order
* Refactoring routes as separate modules, making it easier to extend the server with new functionality
